# Next.js 12 + MUI5 + next-translate starter

This is a Next.js 12 starter based on MUI5 with integrated translations from next-translate (i18n) plugin for the rapid start into development of your next project. 
It also uses MUI5 custom theming (dark and bright modes) with conditional rendering of certain elements according to the chosen mode. Of course it also supports "lazy loading" with next/image static images out of the box and SEO-functionality from next/seo. Additionally you also get the cookie consent component with an opportunity to adjust settings (turn on, turn off Vercel Analytics), as well as the adjusted and isolated translations both for the UI and dynamic content. There is a bunch of fancy components that you can use for the rapid prototyping: appbar, footer, cards, CV page, references page, cross sections (picture + text) and so on. Enjoy :)

## What will come soon?

I will expand the tutorial regarding the usage of this app very soon. I'm also going to add some additional functionality to the consent-manager (opportunity to revoke cookies), create a "leave confirmation dialog component" when you click on the external links,  add a function checking whether you're online or offline with the fallback page if your connection has been lost. Eventually, I will probably update this starter-kit to Next.js 13. Also I will add MDX-Plugin and the "blog" page section.
